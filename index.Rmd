# Intro {.sidebar}

This dashboard covers basic scripting with `R`. The skills in this course serve as an entry level requirement for many of my courses.

# How to prepare

## Column 1

### Preparing your machine for the course
Dear all, 

Chances are that you aim to prepare yourself for one of my courses. These exercises will help you to master the basic scripting skills required for a succesfull programming career in `R`. 

If you run into trouble, please drop me a line. 

I look forward to see you all,  

*Gerko Vink*

### **System requirements**

You will need a laptop or desktop computer with full write access and administrator rights to the machine. We will explore programming and compiling in these exercises. This means that you need full access to your machine. Some corporate laptops (including Dutch university laptops) come with limited access for their users. I therefore advice you to bring a personal laptop computer, if you have one. 

### **1. Install `R`**
`R` can be obtained [here](https://cran.r-project.org). We won't use `R` directly in the course, but rather call `R` through `RStudio`. Therefore it needs to be installed. 

### **2. Install `RStudio` Desktop**

Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It can be obtained as stand-alone software [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). The free and open source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient.

### **3. Start RStudio and install the following packages. **

Execute the following lines of code in the console window:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tidyverse", "magrittr", "micemd", "jomo", "pan", 
                 "lme4", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "plotly", "ggplot2", "shiny", 
                 "devtools", "boot", "class", "car", "MASS", "ggplot2movies", 
                 "ISLR", "DAAG", "mice", "mitml", "miceadds"), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```

If you are not sure where to execute code, use the following figure to identify the console:

<center>
  <img src="console.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 70%>
</center>

Just copy and paste the installation command and press the return key. When asked 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs 
compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

type `Yes` in the console and press the return key. 

## Column 2

### **What if the steps to the left do not work for me?**
If all fails and you have insufficient rights to your machine, the following web-based service will offer a solution. 

1. Open a free account on [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). You can run your own cloud-based `RStudio` environment there. 

Naturally, you will need internet access for these services to be accessed. 

# Exercises

## Column 1

### `R` exercises
The introductory `R` exercise is threefold. We need to cover a lot of ground in these exercises to get you started with `R`.

- Make [Exercise 1](Exercise/Exercise_1_walkthrough.html). This exercise will get you started with `R` and `RStudio`.
- Make [Exercise 2](Exercise/Exercise_2_walkthrough.html).
- Make [Exercise 3](Exercise/Exercise_3_walkthrough.html).

### Exercise discussion
The below videodiscussions for the practical exercises explain the train of thought in the above exercise documents.
